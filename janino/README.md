## Janino

Janino is a super-small, super-fast Java compiler.

Janino can not only compile a set of source files to a set of class files like JAVAC, but also compile a Java expression, block, class body or source file in memory, load the bytecode and execute it directly in the same JVM.

JANINO is integrated with Apache Commons JCI ("Java Compiler Interface") and JBoss Rules / Drools.

JANINO can also be used for static code analysis or code manipulation.
